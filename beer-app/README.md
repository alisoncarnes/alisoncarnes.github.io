The is called BeerxABV. I used an api from https://punkapi.com/ in order to create an app that uses the user input of the alcohol percentage (abv) to show a list of ten beers that match around that number. The output includes the beers name, flavor profile, description and a food pairing as well. 

The technologies implemented for this app include HTML, CSS, AJAX, JQuery and Javascript. I also added a carousel of photos for the header and a modal users can view for an About me of the site as well as how the app works.

In the future I would like to fix the mobile design as well as update the javascript to have it so the beers that are shown are in a tighter percentage range.
